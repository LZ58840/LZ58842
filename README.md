# /u/LZ58842
A specialized reddit bot designed to handle trivial `/r/Animewallpaper` moderation jobs.

It is able to evaluate incoming/unmoderated submissions that fall in one or more of the following cases:
- Resolution does not satisfy the subreddit rule requirements
- Aspect ratio does not satisfy the subreddit rule requirements
- No resolution stated in title
- Misleading resolution in title

Should a submission fall under the above cases, the bot will automatically remove it and provide an appropriate comment.
